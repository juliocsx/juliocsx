# Hey everyone 👋

My name is Julio Cesar, and 2022 was a year of change for me.

I decided to try this new area where a lot of people i know work on, and i always wanted to try, but never had the guts to do it.

After some time of struggle, i decided that it was the time to move on, and so i did!

Now here i am, in this new universe, trying to learn as much as i can. 🙂
